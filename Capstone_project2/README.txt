Grasp-and-Lift EEG Detection

Imagine that you can control a robot with your brain, imagine that someday all the neuro -degenerative patients or disabled patients can help themselves at well. Understanding brain signals and their meaning via EEG is important and can be beneficial to disabled patients. Here, this study is to identify when a hand is grasping, lifting, and replacing an object using EEG data. The algorithm be can also applied into future computational neuroscience applications.
